### Hello! 🐒
I'm Johnny Zheng, a Computer Science student at Indiana University - Bloomington.

I'm super passionate about using technology, problem solving, and creativity to build products that have a real impact on people. As a life-long learner, I have worked on many personal and collaborative projects while adding new tools/technologies under my belt.

Facts about me:
 - 💻️ I’m specializing in Software Engineering and AI, with minors in Data Science and Informatics
 - 🎺 I have a deep love for the marching arts (and music in general)
 - 🧗 Hitting the climbing gym a few times a week helps me recharge
 - ⌨️ I love mechanical keyboards! (HHKBs in particular)
